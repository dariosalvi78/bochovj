= Introduction =

I'm Dario Salvi, aka BochoVJ, an hobbyist VJ and a maker.
As I'm doing some research with video synthesis (Processing, PureData), physical computing (Arduino, Minia, RFduino) and old style VJing (Resolume controlled by MIDI), I decided to publish the code I am producing as open source.

I warmly welcome contributions from you (that's why the code is public), and I would be very happy to see people using what I've produced.

= Project content =

The project contains five directories:

  * [Android]
  * [Arduino]
  * [Fritzing]
  * [Java]
  * [Processing]
  * [PureData]
