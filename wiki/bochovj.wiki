= Introduction =

I'm Dario Salvi, aka BochoVJ, an hobbyist VJ and a maker.
As I'm doing some research with video synthesis (Processing, PureData), physical computing (Arduino, Minia, RFduino) and old style VJing (Resolume controlled by MIDI), I decided to publish the code I am producing as open source.

I warmly welcome contributions from you (that' why the code is public), and I would be very happy to see people using what I've produced.

= Project content =

The code is shared using SVN.
There are two reasons why I have preferred it: it allows publishing a link to a particular file or directory, and because it permits to use only on part of the repository. (I know that now GIT is becoming popular and allows the same, but at the time I created this repo GIT was not so popular).

The project contains five directories:

  * [Android]
  * [Arduino]
  * [Fritzing]
  * [Java]
  * [Processing]
  * [PureData]
